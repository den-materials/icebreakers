# Intro to WDI and Team

<!--10 minutes -->

### Introductions
<!-- Instructors introductions -->

Let's start with a quick introduction:

- What is your name?
- What were you doing before this course?
- What do you hope to get out of this class?
 
Let's round out those introductions with a small name game
- Attach an adjective to your name that begins with the same letter as your first name

<!-- Instructors will try to name everyone -->

### Trivial Pursuit

 - This activity will require you to answer some really difficult questions.  See how many you can answer on your own. No cheating.  Laptops closed and phones away, please.  Take 4 minutes.
 - Now get into groups of 4 (2 can turn around to face other 2).  See how many more you can get answered.  Take 4 minutes.
 - Now ask Professor Google.  See how many more you can get answered.  Take 2 minutes.
 - Let's talk about what we learned.  Any big takeaways?

### One Cool Thing

 - Throughout this first week, we are expecting you to learn one cool thing about one of your fellow Developers every day.  Since you already have a group to share with, share your one cool thing with the group.
 - Now that we know some cool things about each other, tell the whole class one cool thing you learned about one of your group members.  No repeats, please.
 - We have just done a "Whip-Around", which is another activity we will do a few times in this class.
